## Component Description

### `bin/`
Contains the executables generated after compilation. This directory is automatically created by the Makefile and can be removed with `make clean`.

### `include/`
Contains header files (`.h`) that define the public interfaces of the libraries.

- **bmp_utils.h**: Defines the `Image` and `Pixel` structures, as well as functions for reading and writing BMP files.

### `src/`
Contains all source code (`.c`) files of the project.

- **bmp_utils.c**: Implements functions for reading and writing 24-bit BMP files.
- **sequential.c**: Sequential version of the image processing pipeline.
- **mpi_version.c**: Parallel version using MPI for distributed processing.
- **openmp_version.c**: Parallel version using OpenMP for shared-memory processing.

### `scripts/`
Contains helper scripts to facilitate project usage.

- **test.sh**: Script that runs all versions with different configurations and calculates performance metrics (speedup and efficiency).

## Compilation Flow

1. The `Makefile` reads source files from `src/`
2. Includes headers from `include/` using the `-Iinclude` flag
3. Compiles and generates executables in `bin/`

## Conventions

- **Headers**: All headers are in `include/`
- **Source code**: All `.c` code is in `src/`
- **Executables**: All binaries are in `bin/`
- **Scripts**: Helper scripts are in `scripts/`
- **Documentation**: `.md` files in the project root
